### 📍 **🌍 Global Sustainable Development Analysis**

**Description:**
In this project, I analyzed global indicators like economy, population, and CO₂ emissions to help a non-profit organization compare countries on key sustainability issues. I used the Global Country Information Dataset (2023), along with data on sustainable energy and migrants, to explore correlations between these factors.

Key Questions Explored:

Which countries lead in renewable energy and CO₂ reduction?

How do countries rank in healthcare and education?

Are there correlations between economy, health, and education?

**Technologies Used:**

SQL, Python (Pandas), and Tableau/Power BI for data analysis and visualization.**
